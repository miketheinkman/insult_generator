# insult_generator
## this is a [python_under_the_influence()](http://pythonundertheinfluence.com) tutorial


### insult_generator is what I call a rather large beginner project

I tried to build a much more interesting and extensive project than a "Hello World" that features:
* Extensive commenting
* Iterations, Try blocks, Conditionals, SQL, and other stuff you don't see in beginner projects
* Explanations regarding different Python versions

### I plan to expand this tutorial into a Heroku Flask/Bootstrap app, and possibly a Kivy app for Android

## Instructions
* Clone this repo or download zip file
* Run app.py in terminal ```python app.py```
* Add directives, adjectives, and names to database through the *_configure database_* menu
  * Directives examples: "Go fuck yourself", "Rodeo ride an inverted bull"
  * Adjectives examples: "smarmy", "retarded"
  * Names examples: "asshole", "douchebag"
* Generate insults

The results would be something like "Suck start a camel, you ignorant mongoloid dick."

## Future plans
* SMTP to spam friends with insults
* Possible SMS to insult bomb through text

#### Disclaimer:
We are all adults here. This app is fun and I hope it keeps you interested. However, if you set up 40 different dummy emails and use them to spam government officials or some dumb shit like that, that's on you. But please take screenshots and send them to me, for "documentation purposes".
